Petition is a web app created as one of the projects of my FullStack Web Development bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

Even though the course is mainly focused on browser experiences, I decided to make this project responsive on the main mobile screens.
In this project I learned how to use cookies for a user login experience.
The app is made with Node.js/Express and Handlebars.

The user can sign up and login to sign a mock petition, with the function to draw their signature on the screen (wether with touchscreen or mouse) using Canvas. The signature is then saved in a database and is available only to the user. The user can then see all other petition on a list, without their drawn signatures.

The main focus here was to learn to use the database in a safe manner, avoiding dirty or malicious user input.

This project was deployed on Heroku and can be seen at https://savas-petition.herokuapp.com/
